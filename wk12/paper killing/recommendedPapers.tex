\section{Improved interfaces for Human-robot interaction in urban search and rescue}
This paper did not provide a useful discussion topic for class participation. It did however provide a good example of a bad paper I felt. The paper did not provide a contribution to the fild of robotics and  the GUI advances they made were arbitrary and they did not provide a useful comparison with other modern methods.

\section{Relational Artifacts with Children and Elders}
This paper as was witnessed did not provide much discussion in class, although this may have been due to the fact that the other paper started such a strong fire with everyone. This paper was not very good in general and it did not contribute to robotics research. The paper was simply a list of observations rather than actual research. There was no attempt to validate the thoughts that were present in the paper. However the paper was a great example of how a person can get caught up in their research and use unique cases to prove their ideas. It illustrates an important lesson when doing research as a professor.
